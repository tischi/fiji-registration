# fiji-registration

This repository contains information about registration algorithms (in Fiji). 

## things to try

### x,y,z maximum projections with stackreg and then 3-D with TransformJ

- would have to write code

### elastix 

- works very well, seems very complete
- http://elastix.isi.uu.nl
- wrap into Fiji

### Perrine's java code

- try to get it running

### Amira

- ???

### Icy with ec-CLEM Plugin

- only 2D or with manual annotation

### Imglib2

- Saalfeld: "Tobias implemented the basic Thenevaz approach for full affines some
years ago for ImgLib2. It's in one of the advanced tutorials and works
in an arbitrary number of dimensions. Images need to be approximately
registered."
